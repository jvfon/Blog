# Settings Data

## Content

Open up settings_data.json in the config folder. 

```
{
  "current": "Default",
  "presets": {
    "Default": { }
  }
}
```
```
  "current": "Default",
```
It means there is no settings. Shopify will put its own default values.  

The moment you save and start changing the theme settings from the shopify website, these changes will be reflected here.
