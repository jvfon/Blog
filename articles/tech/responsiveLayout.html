   <h3>In this tutorial we are going to explore how to build a basic responsive layout</h3>

   <h4>use percentages instead of a fixed width. </h4>
   <p>
      By default a webpage is responsive, but when we add CSS we remove that feature from a webpage.
   </p>
   <p>
      By default divs have a width of 100% of the parent. When we set fixed width in pixels or any other measurement, we remove the ability of the webpage to be responsive. Let's say the width of a div is set at 900px. Everything is fine when the browser is fully extended but when the browser is smaller than the 900px, we get side scrolling. 
   </p>
   <p>
      In contrast, if we set the width using percentages, the div will always be at a percentage of the parent no matter if the browser is big or small.
